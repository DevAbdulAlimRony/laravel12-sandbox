## Artisan:
Artisan is the command line interface included with Laravel.
1. php artisan list or sail list to see all pre-built commands.
2. Run php artisan commands in sail project: docker exec -it your-container-name bash
3. or, easy way: sail shell
4. php artisan list -h: Extra information about the specific command.
5. php artisan list --format=md
6. php artisan route:list,php artisan route:list --except-vendor, php artisan route, php artisan list route

## Tinker:
Laravel Tinker is a powerful REPL for the Laravel framework, powered by the PsySH package.
A REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is an interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs, executes them immediately, and returns the result to the user.
1. Laravel automatically include tinker. If removed, install: composer require laravel/tinker
2. Enter the tinker environment: php artisan tinker
3. Can publish Tinker's configuration file to add own custom commands: php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Laravel\Tinker\TinkerServiceProvider"
4. We can run code in tinker like- new Date(), new PaymentService()
5. But after editing code, tinker can't hot reload so you have to exit by ctrl+c and again enter the tinker environment.
6. We can run this command directly: up (live mode), down (app will be in maintenance mode), env, inspire, migrate, migrate:install, optimize.
7. We can add our custom commands in published config file.
8. Tinker always alias classes, if you dont want any class to alias add it into tinker.php config file:
'dont_alias' => [
    App\Models\User::class,
]
