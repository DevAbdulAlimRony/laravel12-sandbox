Package.json:
1. "private": true: As Laravel apps are not npm packages, Prevents this project from being accidentally published to npm.
2. "type": "module": Tell node.js to Use ES Modules (ESM) syntax by default.
3. "scripts": Shortcuts for common commands.
4. "dev": "vite": npm run dev     # start dev server (hot reload)
5. "build": "vite build": npm run build   # build production assets.
6.  devDependencies: Packages needed only during development or build time.
7.  dependencies: Packages needed at runtime in the browser.
8.  If the browser needs it → dependencies, If only the build process needs it → devDependencies.
9.  The browser never reads package.json, The browser only downloads bundled JavaScript files generated by Vite.
10. If we put every packages in devDependencies, it will work also. But for some projects like nuxt. node based rendering etc. node must run vue after build. So, we need dependencies also.
11. Lock json file: It is a lock file that records the exact versions of every npm package installed — including nested dependencies.
12. Locak file locks exact versions, exact dependency tree, exact resolved URLs, checksums for security.

Composer.json:
1. "$schema": Enables IDE validation & autocomplete, Helps editors catch mistakes, No runtime effect.
2. "name": Package identifier (vendor/package), Not important for private apps.
3. "type": "project": Tells Composer this is a full application, Enables project-specific behaviors
4. description and keyword Just for human readable description and package discovery, no runtime impact.
5. "license": Important for legal clarity, No runtime impact. MIT is a software license- It tells other people what they are allowed to do with your code.
6. "require": { ... }: composer install --no-dev. Runtime dependencies, Required in production.
7. "require-dev": { ... }: Development-only dependencies. Used for testing, debugging, formatting.
8.  autoloading: Defines PSR-4 class autoloading, Maps namespaces → folders, Used in production + dev. App\User  → app/User.php. This allows automatic class loading, no require / include needed. 
    - namespace App\Http\Controllers; Composer sees: "App\\": "app/", So it looks for: app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php.
    - You can add your own namespace.
9.  "scripts": { ... }: Defines custom command shortcuts.
10. "post-autoload-dump": [ ... ]: Runs after Composer regenerates autoload files, Discovers Laravel packages.
11. post-update-cmd: Runs after composer update, Republishes framework assets.
12. post-root-package-install: Runs when project is first created, Ensures .env exists.
13. "post-create-project-cmd": [ ... ]:  Runs after composer create-project.
14. "pre-package-uninstall": [ ... ]: Runs before uninstalling a package, allow cleanup hooks.
15. "dont-discover": []: Empty array = allow all, Controls package auto-discovery.
16. "config": { ... }: Controls how Composer behaves.
17. "optimize-autoloader": true: Generates class map, Faster autoloading, Recommended for production.
18. "preferred-install": "dist": Prefers zip archives over git clones, Faster installs, Smaller disk usage.
19. "sort-packages": true: Keeps composer.json sorted automatically.
20. "allow-plugins": { ... }: Security feature, Explicitly allows Composer plugins, Prevents malicious plugin execution.
21. "minimum-stability": "stable": Only allows stable versions, Prevents accidental beta/alpha installs.
22. "prefer-stable": true: If mixed versions allowed, prefer stable ones.
